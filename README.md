How It Works

- Start at the splash screen; if you’re signed in, you go to the main page, otherwise you go through onboarding with Google sign-in.
- On the main page, browse categories and a list of brands loaded from a database. Search and mark favorites, view brand details, and compose an email.
- Send emails via your Gmail account (with OAuth permissions); the app saves a local record and can fetch Gmail thread summaries if you grant read access.
- Manage conversations in the Mail Inbox: open threads, reply, trash, or edit and re-compose messages.
- Optional AI can rewrite your email text to be clearer and more professional.
